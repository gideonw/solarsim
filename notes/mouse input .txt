if the mouse is in the interface it gets focus
otherwise the cursor goes to the game world

always apes it to the interface and if it is going to use it then I will have it return true thus we can prevent it from going to the world

if( look key pressed)
	send mouse to camera

else if(interface-injectMouse)
	//interface used it
else
	game gets the cursor
